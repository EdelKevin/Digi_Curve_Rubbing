# Digi_Curve_Rubbing
I am trying to input extraordinary Circuit of the Americas aka.COTA into CarSim. CarSim>>Path>>Segment Builder allows user using Straight/Curvature/Radius to build the path. Using this DIgi_Curve_Rubbing you can input an overlooking road and out a series of straight line and arch which fit the real road and deviation under 1%.
